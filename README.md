# ProperNameCase

A Javascript/TypeScript-friendly library for fixing the capitalization of people's names, but only if they're all upper or lower case. For the most part we don't what to change what a person does since there are A LOT of possibilities.

Influenced upon Perl's [Lingua-EN-NameCase](https://metacpan.org/pod/Lingua::EN::NameCase) module.
